        Metals in the first column or Group 1 of the periodic table (i.e.
        lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and francium)
      </li>
      <li>
        These elements react vigorously, even violently, with water and must be

      </li>
      <li>
        When the surface of these metals comes into contact with oxygen in the

    <h2>Naming Ionic Compounds:</h2>
    <h3>(Compounds composed of a metal and a non-metal)</h3>
    <p><i>Rules for naming</i></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Name the metallic ion (Cation) first, followed by the non-metallalic
        (Anion)(the non-metallic ion ends in "ide")
      </li>
      <li>Ionic compounds always start with a metal or an ammonium ion</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Balancing Ionic compounds</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>When given the name, write the symbol and charge for each ion</li>
      <li>Remember all compounds are electrically neutral</li>
      <li>
        Use subscrpits to equalize the total number of positive and negative
        charges
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>The Stock System</h3>
    <p>
      <b>The Stock System:</b> Some ions can exist with differnet ion charges in
      different situations. For example, iron can exist as Fe<sup>3+</sup> and
      Fe<sup>2+</sup>. To distinguish one from the other, Roman numerals are
      used in the name of compounds that are made with ions that can have
      different charges
    </p>
    <h3>Polyatomic Ions</h3>
    <p>
      All polyatomic ions but Ammonium are anions, which means they are at the
      end of the compound.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        When there are multiple of the same ployatomic ion in a compound, use
        brackets to show the entire ion is modified by the subscrpits
      </li>
      <li>
        Traditionally, the most common of a polyatomic ion type, like nitrate
        and nitrite, with end with -ate.
      </li>
      <li>
        This means that nitrate, phosphate, chlorate, and sulfate are the most
        common pairings of nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorine, and sulfer with
        oxygen, respectively
      </li>
      <li>
        If you know a ployatomic anion's oxygen count, you should be able to
        tell what all other counts will be in that family
      </li>
      <li>
        The sufixes of the different anions with oxygen tell you how many oxygen
        ions are in the complete ion. The hierarchy goes as follows:
        <p class="tablep">-Per____ate</p>
        <p class="tablep">-____ate</p>
        <p class="tablep">-____ite</p>
        <p class="tablep">-Hypo____ite</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        The oxygen goes down as you go down this list, and goes up when you go
        up the list
      </li>
      <li>
        For example, if you know nitrate is NO<sub>3</sub>, then you can know
        pernitrate is NO<sub>4</sub>, nitrite is NO<sub>2</sub>, and hyponitrite
        is NO (No subscrpit number means there is one of that ion)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Hydrated Compounds</h4>
    <p>When found in nature, compounds are combined with water when formed</p>
    <p><i>Naming Rules</i></p>
    <ol>
      <li>The first half of the name is the complete ionic compound name</li>
      <li>
        After the ionic compound, the amount of water molecules is denoted by
        the atomic prefix followed by "hydrate"
      </li>
      <li>
        For example, with copper II sulfate with 5 water molecules per compound
        molecule, you write Copper II Sulfate Pentahydrate
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Composition of Chemical Compounds</h3>
    <p>
      When single replacement or double replacement reactions occur, they occur
      in water
    </p>
    <img src="img/chem-solubility.png" alt="Solubility Table" />
    <p>
      <i>
        In Science 10, this table has all of the elements you will need to use
        it for</i
      >
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To use the table properly, begin with identifying what elements are in
        the compound, using the anion is easier with this chart. We shall use
        NaCl for this example
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, look for the anion along the top of the chart. The first two
        columns are cations, so look at any of the other ones to find the ion.
        For our example, NaCl, Cl is in the 4th column from the left
      </li>
      <li>
        Now look at the two rows beneath your ion. These rows specify whether a
        compound is an aqueous solution, with your ion in the top row, meaning
        high solubility, or a precipitate (solid), with your ion being in the
        bottom row, meaning low solubility. For our example, since Na isn't
        shown in the bottom row, it is included in the top. This means NaCl in a
        reaction will be aqueous and has high solubility
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Naming Acids</h3>
    <p>
      Acids are ionic compounds that begin with H or end in COOH, and are always
      aqueous
    </p>
    <img src="img/chem-acid-chart.png" alt="Acids Chart" width="600" />
    <h3>Molecular Compounds</h3>
    <p>
      Molecular compounds are composed of only non-metals, and use the atomic
      prefix system as well, however the prefixes refer to the subscript number,
      rather than in hydrates where it referes to the coefficient
      <b
        >NOTE: The mono prefix is only used for the second element where
        neccessary</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few molecular compounds that you need to memorize the formula
      of. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Water H<sub>2</sub>O <sub>(l)</sub></li>
      <li>Ammonia NH<sub>3 (g)</sub></li>
      <li>Ozone O<sub>3 (g)</sub></li>
